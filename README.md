# magic-button

Your average relay bypass for effect pedals, with some tweaks:
- Reproduces the behaviour of mechanical switches (set FX on when button is down, set FX off when button is released)
- Automatic "temporary" mode (when button is held for some configurable time, FX will disengage on release)
